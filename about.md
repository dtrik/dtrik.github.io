### More Information

I am dAmu (written ദാമു in മലയാളം).

I enjoy writing. I enjoy thinking about writing more. This blog has stuff that makes the leap between the two phases. 

This website was originally created by downloading the content from [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and following the instructions at [Smash Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). It has was rebuilt using fast.ai's template. It is now powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)** [^1].GitHub Pages is being used to deploy.

(NB: I am adding my old words from other places on the wide web on here. I feel ashamed looking at a lot of stuff (content and/or quality). I am keeping it as it is (mostly). I am trying to figure out a way to indicate stuff that I disagree with and ~~will update it eventually~~ I have settled on footnotes. I am gradually including it.)
